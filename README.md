# Custom Item Animator Demo

Just a simple RecyclerView demo app written in Kotlin to show how and where someone could use custom interpolators with a custom ItemAnimator.

In this example I'm deriving from SimpleItemAnimator and mostly copying DefaultItemAnimator.

Attached is also a gif showing how setting sDefaultInterpolator with OvershootInterpolator gets the desired effect.
